## Part The First: Jack

Jack was a hardworker, but he was all work and no play.  One day after helping his friend Jill up a nearby hill he decided that he should really relax.  Unfortunately, this led him to a game called el pescado es espectacular, a game that has nothing to do with fish.

## The Game
After sitting down, Jack is greeted by a game screen on it is an azure sky with billowing clouds and below it a city unlike any other.

Under the city is a black box that simply says "hit spacebar to begin".  He does so. Gently.

Bombs begin to fall towards the city! Oh no!  Fortunately he has a way to fight off the bombs!

"type the word RED," suggests the black box.

He does so and the bomb is destroyed.  Though now it looks like more are coming...  To be continued.


## Gameplay Concept

The idea of the game is to create create ever more confusing user actions.  In addition, the speed of the bombs will also increase over time.  Each level will add onto the last.

### Level One

Simple commands and slow bombs

### level three

### level four

    - type peppa pig 
    - don't pepperocini

### level five
Type nothing.  must type "Nothing", after that more bombs will fall.
